## The revolution
This app is a REVOLUTION! Allowing you to store and share your contacts!! (the ones you add in it at least) 

It will store those contacts in a super private database and it can even use the power of the cloud to store them on a server. 
Using the power of the JSON format, it'll magically share the informations at premium speed.

Save a squirrel, download the app ! 




## Install a local JSON Server

In order to install a local server on your computer, you first need to have to NodeJs set up :
https://nodejs.org/en/

Then, we are going to use JSON Server to launch a local server 

Install it with:

``` npm install -g json-server ```

Download the db.json in the repository. This file contains the JSON used to generate the cell in the TableView.

Once it's download, got to the directory of the db.json file and use :

``` json-server --watch db.json ```

Your server should now be up and running! 


If there is any issue, I invite you to check their GitHub page ==> https://github.com/typicode/json-server



<h4>Keep calm and continue coding</h4>
